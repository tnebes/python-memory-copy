# Python Memory Copy

This is a simple test to see how copying files from one place to another can be done by using memory.
Essentially, previously I had copied massive files by creating a `tmp` folder and done it in batches for another project.

This project is here to help me gain the knowledge of how to copy massive files in batches without using an intermediary (such as a harddrive.)
